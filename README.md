## :green_book: About

This is a simple todo app that allows you to add, delete, and mark todos as complete. The app is built using React with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS.
I created this project to practice using React and Tailwind CSS. This was my first time using Tailwind CSS and I really enjoyed it. I will definitely be using it in the future.

## :zap: Usage

Type in a todo in the input field and press the `Add Todo` button to add it to the list. Click on the check mark button to mark the todo as complete. Click on the trash icon to delete the todo.
